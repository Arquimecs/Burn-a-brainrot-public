**FAQ**

**Q: Why isn't there any server code?**
<br>
A: To prevent exploiters, I excluded the server code to keep the anti-cheat methods and preventions private. This was also a request from my client.

**Q: Will this code ever be public?**
<br>
A: If the game ever dies, or we discontinue updates, i'll publish the full code in this repository. Otherwise, not in the near future.
